# Real Estate Wordpress Website
WordPress website for a client in Real Estate with external API data.
This WordPress website uses PHP functions and WordPress hooks along with Javascipt functions which pull data from an external API.

You can browse team listings on the home page, as well as seperate pages for residential and commercial properties.
You can click on a property, or search for a property and through an AJAX function be taken to a new page with additional property details.
The client can change or edit the pages with text as well as add new pages which will automatically appear in the menus.
I did not use any plugins in the development of this site.
